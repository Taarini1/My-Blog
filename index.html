  <h3 class="text-info text-capitalize">I visited in Dec 2018</h3>
  <p class="text-capitalize text-warning">In Thiruvanathapuram, the beautiful capital city of Kerala, I have visited a famous beach. It was the Kovalam beach. It was very beautiful. We had dinner at a restaraunt near the beach. It was a very small restaraunt, but the food was very tasty.I have visited a place where a movie shooting was going on. I loved this trip to such a wonderful place and definitely want to visit again.  </p>

  <h3 class="text-info text-capitalize">I visited in Dec 2019</h3>
  <p class="text-capitalize text-warning">In Karnataka , in the city of Mysore, i have visited a very famous tourist place called the mysore palace. as soon as i went in i was dumbstruck. it was soo huuuuuuge. there were so many rooms , just for two members a queen and a king. how fortunate they are! as soon as i came to the center of the palace i saw a huge throne. i wasnt allowed to sit on it, but i did take a photo. if i was the king of those times, it would have been wonderful! all rooms just for me!!!   </p>
